## SparklyCapybara

![alt text](https://github.com/MiroBro/SparklyCapybara/blob/main/Art/SparklyCapybaraLogo_Small.png)

This is my SECOND compiler (and first language)! âœ¨

**To use project:**
1. Download repository.
2. Write your SparklyCappybara code in the file \SparklyCapybara\InputCode.txt
3. Run the program from the root by writing "dotnet run" in cmd.

**Current limits:**
- Nothing works because it's not finished ðŸ˜€
- There's no documentation on how the language or compiler works because it's not implemented yet.
